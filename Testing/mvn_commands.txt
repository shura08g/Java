mvn clean         - cleans up artifacts created by prior builds
mvn clean install
mvn site          - generates site documentation for this project
mvn compile

Executing Build Phases
You can execute a build phase located inside a build life cycle by passing
the name of the build phase to the Maven command. Here are a few build phase
command examples:

  mvn pre-clean
  mvn compile
  mvn package

Maven will find out what build life cycle the specified build phase belongs to,
so you don't need to explicitly specify which build life cyle the build phase
belongs to.

Common Maven Commands
Here is a list of common Maven commands plus a description of what they do:

Maven Command	Description
mvn clean	Clears the target directory into which Maven normally builds
                your project.
mvn package	Builds the project and packages the resulting JAR file into the
                target directory.
mvn install	Builds the project described by your Maven POM file and installs
                the resulting artifact (JAR) into your local Maven repository
